	<p>
	  The 30th Postgraduate Combinatorial Conference (PCC) will be
	  held at the University of Warwick in April of
	  2026. <b>Registrations are open until <s>2nd of March</s>
	  9th of March (<span style="color: red;">extended
	  deadline</span>).</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	  The PCC is a well-established three-day event promoted by
	  the British Combinatorial Committee. The conference is
	  organised by, and for, current research students in all
	  areas of combinatorial and discrete mathematics. The PCC is
	  mainly aimed at UK-based students but is also open to those
	  from abroad.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The main goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity
	  for research students to discuss their research in a relaxed
	  environment, to gain practice at presenting their research
	  outside of their own department and to meet other
	  researchers in their area. Each student is encouraged to
	  contribute by giving a talk.
	</p>

      <p>
	Attendees are strongly encouraged to give a 20-minute (plus 5
	minutes for questions) talk related to their
	interests/research in combinatorics. Although we will try to
	accommodate all talks, in (the unlikely) case that we receive
	more submissions than slots, abstracts will be selected at the
	discretion of the organisers. <b>The deadline for abstract
	submissions is 16th of March</b>.

      <section>
	<h3 class="major">Financial support</h3>

	  addition, we will be able to provide some financial support
	  for travel and accommodation expenses. Please note that we
	  cannot reimburse accommodation costs if you are staying at
	  an Airbnb. Attendees giving contributed talks will be
	  prioritised for funding. When filling the registration form,
	  please indicate if you would like to apply for this, and
	  estimate the required amount. You will be informed of how
	  much funding we can offer you after registration closes.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We have allocated part of our grants to fund child-care
	  services for visiting researchers. To take advantage of this
	  opportunity, it is recommended that you make contact with the
	  organisers at the earliest convenience to ensure proper
	  arrangements are made.
